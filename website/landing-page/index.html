                                is a free, open source textbook appropriate for
                                a first or second year undergraduate course for
                                math and computer science majors. The book is
                                especially well-suited for courses that
                                incorporate inquiry-based learning. Since Spring
                                2013, the book has been used as the primary
                                textbook or a supplemental resource at more than
                                200 colleges and universities around the world

                            <h3>About the book</h3>
                            <p>
                                The text began as a set of lecture notes for the
                                discrete mathematics course at the University of
                                Northern Colorado. This course serves both as an
                                introduction to topics in discrete math and as
                                the &quot;introduction to proofs&quot; course
                                for math majors. The course is usually taught
                                with a large amount of student inquiry, and this
                                text is written to help facilitate this.
                                Originally designed to support future math
                                teachers, the text has a friendly and informal
                                tone, and puts an emphasis on
                                <em>understanding</em> the included concepts,
                                rather than simply memorizing procedures. The
                                book has also been successfully used in courses
                                catering to computer science students, who also
                                benefit from the deeper understanding it
                                promotes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Four main topics are covered: counting,
                                sequences, logic, and graph theory. Along the
                                way, proofs are introduced, including proofs by
                                contradiction, proofs by induction, and
                                combinatorial proofs. An introductory chapter
                                covering mathematical statements, sets, and
                                functions helps students gain familiarity with
                                the language of mathematics, and two additional
                                topics (generating functions and number theory)
                                are also included.

                                While the book began as a set of lecture notes,
                                it now contains a number of features that should
                                support its use as a primary textbook:

                                    473 exercises, including 275 with solutions
                                    and another 109 with hints. Exercises range
                                    from easy to quite involved, with many
                                    problems suitable for homework.

                                    in boxes, etc.).
